# Practice Repository for LeetCode

Welcome to my practice repository! This repo serves as a collection of my coding exercises and projects as I work through LeetCode problems in C++ and Python.

## Repository Structure

- **LeetCode Solutions (C++ and Python):**
  - A dedicated folder containing my solutions to various LeetCode problems.
  - Each solution is organized by problem category (e.g., arrays, strings, dynamic programming).
  - For each problem, you'll find a `.cpp` file with a well-documented solution that outlines the approach
