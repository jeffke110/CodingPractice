# Modern C++ Mastery: Intermediate to Advanced Concepts

This repository documents my progress through a comprehensive course designed to elevate my C++ skills to an intermediate-to-advanced level. The course focuses on modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17), with in-depth coverage of the Standard Template Library (STL), including algorithms. The final project involves developing a game using the SFML graphics library.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of modern C++ features
- Mastery of the Standard Template Library (STL)
- Development of safer, more efficient, and expressive code
- Practical experience in game development with SFML

## Prerequisites
- Intermediate knowledge of C++
- Compiler supporting C++11/14/17
